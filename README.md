# Leaflet_Challenge

1. Get data set
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. Click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' to get a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for visualization.

2. Import & Visualize the Data
Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.


Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth  appear darker in color.


Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


Your visualization should look something like the map above.
